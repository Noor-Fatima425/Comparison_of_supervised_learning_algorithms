# Comparison_of_supervised_learning_algorithms
The main purpose of this project is:
--to implement theoretical knowledge of various classification algorithms into real-world datasets
--compare them based on confusion matrix and accuracy score

# Types of supervised learning algorithms used:
1. Logistic Regression => Accuracy: 0.9414893617021277
2. Decision Tree classifier => Accuracy: 0.9468085106382979
3. K-Nearest Neighbors => Accuracy: 0.6968085106382979
4. SVM (default RBF kernel) => Accuracy: 0.9649122807017544
5. Random Forest Classifier(ensemble learning) => Accuracy: 0.956140350877193

Accuracy order: 4>5>2>1>3

# Winner: SVM! :)
